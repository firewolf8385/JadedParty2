# Toggles Debug Mode. When enabled, the plugin will log everything it is doing.
# Useful for diagnosing cross-server communication issues.

# Toggles standalone mode. When enabled, the plugin will not attempt to sync parties between servers.
# Instead, it will automatically remove players from the party when they leave.

# Modifies how parties functionally work.
Party:

  # Party ids are stored as "NanoIDs".
  # The following settings change how those Ids are generated.
  ID:
    # The characters that are used when generating the id. This *is* case-sensitive.
    alphabet: "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789"

    # The minimum length of the party's generated ID.
    minLength: 8

    # The maximum length of the party's generated ID. Must be greater than or equal to minLength.
    maxLength: 8

    # Configurable prefix to include in front of the randomly generated section of the ID.
    # Does not count towards the min/max length.
